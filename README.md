- 👋 Hi, I’m Robert. 
- 👀 I’m interested in computers! Everything digital really. From gaming to crypto.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, and will probably start building small projects from The Odin Project first,
      until I'm proficient enough to build my own ideas and projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything I can. 
- 📫 How to reach me on Discord: Robhimself#3281
