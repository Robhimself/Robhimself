- 👋 Hi, I’m Robert. 
- 👀 I’m interested in computers! Everything digital really. From gaming to crypto.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning penetration testing, working through https://tryhackme.com/ - https://academy.hackthebox.com/ and https://app.hackthebox.com/. It's fun, engaging and I love it!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything I can.
