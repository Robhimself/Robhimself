I'm a junior software developer with a background in the oil industry, where I worked as a welding inspector and process operator for over 10 years. After attending Get Academy for 24 weeks, I transitioned to a career in software development, focusing on C#. I'm currently undertaking a 12-month internship to gain practical experience and further develop my skills. I'm passionate about learning more about ethical hacking and diving deeper into the lower-level workings of computers.
